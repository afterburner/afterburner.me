  <h2>Challenge: Valentine's Day Cards</h2>
</div>
<p>Write an iOS application where users create a Valentine's Day Card, with a
  photo selected from a Flickr search and a custom message.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Be creative with what you build, but make sure your application fulfills these requirements:</p>
<ol>
  <li>User can search Flickr for a photo. Learn more about the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr API</a>.</li>
  <li>Once a photo is selected, the user can add a written message to the photo.</li>
  <li>Store the photo/message combinations in such a way where the user can retrieve previously created combinations.</li>
  <li>Place your code in a GitHub repo. On the <a href="/apply">form</a>, you can select which repo to submit with your application. Be sure your application builds and runs without modification!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example Wireframes</h3>
<p>Only as an example, your application might have three screens like these wireframes: one for
searching Flickr and selecting an image, one for adding text and one for retreiving stored cards. Note,
your application does not have to conform to these wireframes; they are only provided to clarify the requirements.</p>
