<h3>Design Medal Icons</h3>
<p>Take a look at anyone's profile from the leaderboard and you'll notice that
all the medals they've won have the same icon. Wouldn't it be cool if each medal
had its own graphical identity? Yeah, we think so too. Help us by designing
some medal icons. Contact us at <a href="mailto:contribute@afterburner.me">contribute@afterburner.me</a> to get started.</p>
